# AutoScout24 EDA_Clarusway

## What is this project?

- In this project, we were given a dirty dataset of an online site called AutoScout24, which is used to buy and sell new and used vehicles, motorcycles and accessories, with 56 features belonging to 9 car brands from a certain range.
- Our aim here was to make the dataset given to us ready for Machine Learning.
- In this direction, our group, consisting of 9 people, completed the tasks that we had to do in all the features.

## How was this project done and what tools were used?

- We completed this project with my other 8 teammates in a period of 9 days.
- We applied Agile Scrum methodology during the project process. In this way, we were able to control our progress and also exchanged ideas.
- We collected our collaborative notebook works that we created over Google Colab.
- In the project, we used Github, Google Colab and Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Regex, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy.

## My roles in the project:

Here we passed the dataset given to us through the following stages:
* Detection of None data,
* Dropping features with a high percentage of Null Data,
* Data Cleaning
* Handling Missing Value
* Handling Outliers
* Feature Engineering
* Converting categoric features into numbers

## Results;
* In this project I realized how difficult it is to get the data into a certain order.
* I learned how to make dirty datasets fit.
* Since I had done the same project with a different data set before, I was able to look at this project in a very different way. With this, I realized how important the project experience is.
